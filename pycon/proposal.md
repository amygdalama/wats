# Category
Python Core

# Duration
30 minutes

# Description
> If your talk is accepted this will be made public and printed in the program. Should be one paragraph, maximum 400 characters.

Most of us have experienced unexpected behavior of Identity, Mutability, or Scope in the CPython interpreter, but we might not have a rigorous understanding of why these unexpected behaviors occur. For each of these three topics, we'll look at some common surprising behaviors, investigate the cause of the behaviors, and cover some practical tips on how to avoid related bugs.

# Audience
> Who is the intended audience for your talk? (Be specific; "Python programmers" is not a good answer to this question.)
Programmers curious about Identity, Mutability, or Scope

# Python Level
Novice

# Objectives
> What will attendees get out of your talk? When they leave the room, what will they know that they didn't know before?
Participants will leave the talk with a rigorous understanding of what causes common Pyton WATs, tools for avoiding bugs caused by these surprising behaviors, and some fun Python trivia.
